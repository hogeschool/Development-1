    "## Introduction\n",
    "This is the course descriptor for the _Development 1_ course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Development 1 covers a basic introduction to computational concepts needed to learn programming languages in general. The course opens with a description of computations as transitions in a state machine, defining what _state_ means and what for operations cane be performed on it; the course then moves on to defining statements and expressions, their basic syntax, and their semantics as manipulation of the state that also alters the current program in order to store progress in the program itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important reminder: the course (nor the Informatica degree of Hogeschool Rotterdam, for that matter) is not meant to provide students with a series of tips and tricks to be quickly successful at one's job. Rather, the course aims to build a solid foundation upon which learning of all sorts of programming languages will be based. This *will*, without a doubt, prepare students not only for their first professional tasks, but for all their evolutions. Moreover, understanding of these concepts will allow students to wield their professional tools (programming languages) with certainty instead of intuition, thereby greatly increasing the quality of what they deliver and their value on the job market."

    "### Learning goals\n",
    "The course has the following learning goals:\n",
    "- (TH1) students _understand_ components of a programming language: statements and expressions, state, transitions, and the denotational definition of semantics;\n",
    "- (PR1) students can _read and understand code_; _understand_ here means that students can describe the effect of running the program by predicting the sequence of state transitions produced by its execution;\n",
    "- (PR2) students can _write small snippets of code_ in order to complete an existing program, from a clearly given specification of the state transitions that the completed program is expected to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course, and therefore also the learning goals, are limited to simple imperative programs and the following Python 3 statements and expressions: `if`, `while`, `=`, `+`, `-`, `/`, `//`, `*`, `str`, `print`."

    "### Exam\n",
    "The exam is divided in two:\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "- (FA) a series of five *forward assignments*, that is excercises where given full code, and partial state transitions produced by the code, students are requested to predict the missing state transitions the code will produce;\n",
    "- (MC) a series of ten *multiple choice* questions on the formal interpretation of state transitions induced by statements, expression evaluation, and state manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice\n",
    "- (BA) a series of five *backward assignments*, that is excercises where given partial code, and the desired state transitions, students are requested to fill in the missing code that matches the given state transitions;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scoring\n",
    "The theory results in a grade which is either passed or failed. Each question awards one single point. Students who score at least 75% of the total points will get a passing grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practice results in a full grade. Each assignment awards one full point if completed. Students who score at least 55% of the total points will get a passing grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final grade is the grade of the practice, if and only if the theory was passed. If the theory is not passed, the final grade is insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that, even though there are more FA's and MC's than BA's, the BA's require actively _writing code_, which is significantly more complex than reading code and describing states and bindings, seen that it combines technical understanding and creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If only one of the exam parts is passed, then only the other will need to be retaken.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exam matrix\n",
    "The exam covers all learning goals.\n",
