    "## Introduction\n",
    "This is the course descriptor for the _Development 1_ course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Development 1 covers a basic introduction to computational concepts needed to learn programming languages in general. The course opens with a description of computations as transitions in a state machine, defining what _state_ means and what for operations can be performed on it; the course then moves on to defining statements and expressions, their basic syntax, and their semantics as manipulation of the state that also alters the current program in order to store progress in the program itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important reminder: the course (and the whole Informatica degree of Hogeschool Rotterdam as well, for that matter) is not meant to provide students with a series of tips and tricks to be quickly successful at one's job. Rather, the course aims to build a solid foundation upon which learning of all sorts of programming languages will be based. This *will*, without a doubt, prepare students not only for their first professional tasks, but for all their evolutions. Moreover, understanding of these concepts will allow students to wield their professional tools (programming languages) with certainty instead of intuition, thereby greatly increasing the quality of what they deliver and their value on the job market."

    "### Learning goals\n",
    "The course has the following learning goals:\n",
    "- (ICODE) students can _recognize and formally interpret_ components of a programming language: statements and expressions, state, transitions, and the denotational definition of semantics;\n",
    "- (ECODE) students _understand code_; _understand_ here means that students can describe the effect of running the program by predicting the sequence of state transitions produced by its execution;\n",
    "- (WCODE) students can _write small snippets of code_ in order to complete an existing program, from a clearly given specification of the state transitions that the completed program is expected to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course, and therefore also the learning goals, are limited to simple imperative programs and the following Python 3 keywords and operators: \n",
    "- `if/elif/else`\n",
    "- `while`\n",
    "- `=, +, -, /, //, * (NOT ALLOWED FOR MULTIPLYING STRINGS), %` \n",
    "- `>, >=, <, <=, ==, !=`\n",
    "- `or, and, not`\n",
    "- `int(), float(), str()`\n",
    "- `input()`\n",
    "- `print()`\n",

    "The corresponding competences connected to these learning goals are: \n",
    "- realisation.\n",

    "### Learning materials\n",
    "\n",
    "The mandatory learning materials are:\n",
    "- reader of the lectures, which will be made available one week after the lecture\n",
    "- materials on the Github repository (github.com/hogeschool), which is already online"

    "### Exam\n",
    "The exam is divided in two parts:\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "- (FA) a series of four (4) *forward assignments*, that is exercises where students, given full code and partial state transitions produced by the code, are requested to complete the missing state transitions the code will produce;\n",
    "- (MC) a series of eight (8) *multiple choice* questions on the formal interpretation of state transitions induced by statements, expression evaluation, and state manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice\n",
    "- (BA) a series of five (5) *backward assignments*, that is exercises where students, given partial code and the desired state transitions, are requested to fill in the missing code that matches the given state transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scoring\n",
    "The theory results in a grade which is either PASS or FAIL. Each question awards one single point, if correctly answered. Students who score at least 75% of the total points will get a passing grade (PASS). For example, if the theory exam is made up by 12 questions in total, then a student needs to answer correctly at least 9 questions (since 8/12 = 67% and 9/12 = 75%) to get a PASS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here below you can see some example of results. In the first column you find the percentage of correct answers given by the student. In the second column there is the corresponding grade in a scale from 0 to 10 that you will find in Osiris. The final result of this part of the exam can be seen in the third column: PASS (when the points percentage is higher or equal than 75) or FAIL (otherwise).\n",
    "\n",

    "| ----------------- |:------------------:|:-------------:|\n",

    "| 12.5%             | 0.9                | FAIL          |\n",
    "| 25.0%             | 1.8                | FAIL          |\n",
    "| 37.5%             | 2.8                | FAIL          |\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The practice results in a full grade (from 0 to 10). Each assignment awards one single point, if correctly completed. The grade is computed as the percentage of points obtained, divided by 10. Students who score at least 55% of the total points will thus get a passing grade. For example, if a student completes 3 assignments out of 5, this means obtaining 3 points out of 5, which means 60% and corresponds thus to a 6 (60/10).\n",
    "\n",
    "**You receive the credit points for this course as soon as the theory result is PASS and the practice result is higher or equal than 5.5**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that, even though there are more FA's and MC's than BA's, the BA's require actively _writing code_, which is significantly more complex than reading code and describing states and bindings, seen that it combines technical understanding and creativity.\n",

    "If only one of the exam parts is passed (theory or practice), then only the other will need to be retaken.\n",
