    "The theory results in a grade which is either PASS or FAIL. Each question awards one single point, if correctly answered. Students who score at least 75% of the total points will get a passing grade (PASS). For example, if the theory exam is made up of 12 questions in total, then a student needs to answer correctly at least 9 questions (since 8/12 = 67% and 9/12 = 75%) to get a PASS.\n",

    "Here below you can see some example of results. In the first column you find the percentage of correct answers given by the student. In the second column there is the corresponding grade in a scale from 0 to 10 that you will find in Osiris. The final result of this part of the exam can be seen in the third column: PASS (when the points percentage is higher or equal than 75) or FAIL (otherwise).\n",

    "The practice results in a full grade (from 0 to 10). Each assignment awards one single point, if correctly completed. The grade is computed as the percentage of points obtained, divided by 10. Students who score at least 55% of the total points will thus get a passing grade. For example, if a student completes 3 assignments out of 5, this means obtaining 3 points out of 5, which means 60% and corresponds thus to a 6 (60/10).\n",
