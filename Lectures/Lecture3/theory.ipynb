    "    - we want to treat such important concepts as _primitives_ in our (yet fictional) languages\n",
    "- we introduce the concept of **data types**\n",
    "- a data type is a set $T$ plus a set of distinct operations $Ops$\n",
    "    - $T = \\{ a, b, c, d, ... \\}$ contains all the elements that make up the data type (domain)\n",
    "        - $int = \\{ ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... \\}$\n",
    "    - $Ops = \\{ op^{a_1}_1, op^{a_2}_2, ... \\}$ contains all the operations that can be performed on elements of the data type, plus their arity $a$, which tells us how many elements the operation needs to perform its function\n",
    "        - we can draw an operation of arity $m$ as:\n",

    "        - $int = \\{ +^2, -^2, -^1, *^2, /^2 \\}$ (notice that we have two minus operators, distinugished by arity: what are they?\n",
    "            - let us give examples of applications of operators of $int$ to its elements\n",

    "            - $3 + 2$ is an expression, a piece of code\n",
    "            - when we *run* it, we take (physical) time to convert into an equivalent, but simpler form\n",
    "            - so we *go* from $3 + 2$, an expression, to $5$, a simpler expression that ultimately has the same meaning\n",
    "            - notice that the arrow $3 + 2 \\rightarrow 5$ is left to right\n",

    "        - an operator $op^n$ in a data type always works on $n$ elements of set $T$\n",

    "        - the colon and the comma's in the definition above tell us that $op_n$ will *accept* or *take* a series of *n* parameters taken from $T$, which we call $T_1$, $T_2$, etc.\n",
    "        - the arrow tells us that when the operator is done computing, it will *yield* or *return* yet another value from $T$\n",
    "        - this means that operators are little \"circular arrows\" from $T$ back into $T$\n",
    "        - something to reflect on: do these arrow form a network of arrows, just like the network of all computations?\n",
    "            - if so, then it looks like we have found a recurring theme of computation: following the arrows!\n",

    "            - ...\n",
    "        - `bool`, like all non-trivial data types, has operators to manipulate one or more `bool`'s:\n",
    "            - the simplest operator is `not`, which flips values around\n",

    "        - operators are the usual arithmetic operators `+`, `*`, ...\n",

    "        - remember that `5 // 2` $\\rightarrow$ `2`\n",
    "    - `float` is similar to `int`, in that it has exactly the same operators and precedences, but (some, binary) fractional numbers are also supported\n",
    "        - in `float`, `5.0 / 2.0` $\\rightarrow$ `2.0`\n",
    "    - some languages use different operators for `int` and `float`\n",
    "        - Python uses `//` for `int` division and `/` for float division (**we will use this from now on!**)\n",
