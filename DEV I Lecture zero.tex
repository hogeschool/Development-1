\SlideSection{Introduction}
\SlideSubSection{Course topics}
\begin{slide}{
\item This course is about \textit{basic programming concepts} (DEV I)
\item We will discuss computational concepts
\item Computational thinking
\item Describing computations clearly
}\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{
\item \textit{How does a programming language work?}
\item Memory, variables, conditionals, if-statements, and loops
\item These are already enough to implement anything (of course not handily!)
}\end{slide}

\SlideSubSection{At the end of the course you will be able to...}
\begin{slide}{
\item ...describe algorithms clearly
\item ...write basic programs in Python
\item ...describe the semantics of a basic Python program
}\end{slide}

\SlideSection{A programming language}
\SlideSubSection{What is programming not about?}
\begin{slide}{
\item computers
\item programming languages
\item technology
\item programs
\item websites
\item smartphones
\item ...
}\end{slide}

\SlideSubSection{What is programming about?}
\begin{slide}{
\item the encoding of logical thought
\item non-ambiguity: there is only one possible mode of execution
\item precision: there is no appeal to vagueness or intuition
}\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{
\item especially if a machine will eventually run our program
\item machines are \textbf{dumb as **ck}\footnote{rock}
}\end{slide}

\SlideSubSection{A programming language specifies}
\begin{slide}{
\item what instructions we have
\item what do they perform
\item in what order
}\end{slide}

\SlideSection{Let's start programming}
\SlideSubSection{The \texttt{stdNt} programming language}
\begin{slide}{
\item In \texttt{stdNt} we let students perform some actions
\item It does not require a machine, but only a white-board and alive (and complying students)
}\end{slide}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\textbf{Following instructions} \textit{(we need a ``volunteer'')}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=shadowbox]
take 3 steps forward
sit on the chair
turn left

\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\SlideSubSection{The features of \texttt{stdNt} so far}
\begin{slide}{
\item \textbf{Instructions}, in English
\item \textbf{Order of execution} is left-to-right, top-to-bottom
\item \textbf{State} made up of a living, breathing student
}\end{slide}

\SlideSubSection{State comes with big preconditions}
\begin{slide}{
\item It only contains information that is:
\begin{itemize}
\item used in a way that makes sense with respect to the instructions
\item logically expressed (numbers, strings, etc. rather than emotions or riddles)
\item actually accessible (there is some connection from the executor to the accessed data)
\end{itemize}
