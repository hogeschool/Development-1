    "We will now introduce a special instruction, which adds a fully new dimension to our programming language. This instruction will make our programs interactive and capable of handling a dialogue with the user. This will make our programs far more interesting, but at the same time more complex: users are unpredictable, and we can never determine beforehand what the user input will look like. Programs handling input should take this substantial unpredictability into account in the form of additional validation statements, which translates into added complexity of our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will define a single instruction, `input`, which \"somehow receives\" a string from the user. We will not focus on the actual mechanism: whether it is an input dialog box, a line typed in a terminal, or something else, it does not matter to us. What does matter is that we expect to find the data from the next user input somewhere in the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will therefore assume that, from now on, the state \"contains\" the sequence of all inputs that the user will ever produce for the product. This makes our state an \"oracle\" of sorts, because it knows in advance what will happen with the user. This \"trick\" is needed when defining how we manage input on paper, because of the fundamental limitation of paper not being an interactive system. This assumption is also not completely ungrounded: we assume that we already know the inputs, but these inputs will indeed be known at some point in time. So what we really do is define how the program did behave, or would behave, given inputs that **did** happen or **would** happen. These past/speculiative inputs will be stored in the state. The new structure of the state will therefore be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\{ \\dots, \\text{input} := \\{ \\text{next} := \\text{\"}\\dots\\text{\"}, \\text{rest} := \\{ \\text{next} := \\text{\"}\\dots\\text{\"}, \\text{rest} := \\{\\dots \\} \\} \\} \\} $$\n",
    "\n",

    "An obvious and immediate consequence of input is that it makes our programs less predictable. We have no access to the input as we are writing the program, and so the program must be able to adjust its behaviour consistently with respect to the inputs it will receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some instructions will, at some point during the evaluation of a program, become a better response than others. This introduces a requirement: our program must be able to choose a statement rather than another based on some dynamically (i.e. only known at runtime) condition. To achieve this goal we can introduce the fundamental instruction to perform choices, known as the *conditional* instruction or *if-then-else*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax if this instruction is `if C then P else Q`, where `C` is an expression, and both `P` and `Q` are statements. We expect `C` to be a boolean expression, that is an expression which will evaluate to either `True` or `False`. Should `C` evaluate to something else, we will interrupt evaluation as the program gets stuck in an error state. \n",
    "\n",
    "When `C` evaluates to `True`, we will then move onto the evaluation of `P`, thereby skipping `Q`. Conversely, when `C` evaluates to `False`, we will then move onto the evaluation of `Q`, thereby skipping `P`.
